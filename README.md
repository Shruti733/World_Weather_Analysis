# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
In this assignment, we have done the following:
- 2000 random latitude and longitude pairs were created to retrieve the nearest cities and performed an
API call with the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Input statements were created to retrieve customer weather preference to identify the potential travel destination and nearby hotels. Those destinations were showwn on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
- Google Directions API was used to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary was created.
